				<h1>About Me</h1>
					<div class="description">
						<p class="description-text">My name is Chris Blackburn and I am a student at Virginia Tech's class of 2020. I am pursuing a degree in the field of computer engineering with intent to Master in Computer Engineering and minor in math, computer science, and cyber security. My passion has always been with engineering, and even more specifically with computers. I love to code and tinker with electronics, I have a passion for the field of robotics, cyber security never ceases to amaze, and I am fascinated with machine intelligence. I am also intrigued by anything having to do with space. The final frontier is something I've enjoying staying in touch with and will continue to do so.</p>
